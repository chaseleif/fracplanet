- Have some suspicions that software GL (maybe only on slow machines?)
  has problems dealing with large meshes.  But meshes as separate
  objects work fine (e.g terrain mesh at subdivision level 4 is fine
  but a cloud mesh in the same scene at subdivision level 5 will break up.
  Something to do with number of vertices a GL implementation caches ?
  Maybe need to break up meshes into smaller chunks.
  All my Nvidia machines (I'll buy an ATI card when I can apt-get
  the drivers) with GeForce2s and later cards work fine.
  [The old machine displaying the problems has a motherboard-mounted
  Riva128 (nv driver) and glxgears doesn't work properly either].

- Base land height doesn't affect noise-only terrain 
  (when vertical perturbation is reduced to zero; probably because
  it's expressed as a proportion of vertical perturbation - should
  just be absolute).

- Blender seems to ignore alpha in the cloud layer, and renders
  it as solid.  It doesn't pass per-vertex alphas out to yafray either.
  This may just be some material flag which needs setting, but haven't
  been able to discover a solution.  Any help appreciated.
  The workround is to emit an opaque pre-blended cloud layer.

- River generation can be VERY slow (especially at high levels of subdivision)
  due to the time taken to fill up large lakes (just like in the real world,
  strangely enough :^): raising the water level slightly to the level of a
  potential outflow currently necessitates adjusting the height of all the
  points in the lake, which takes a long time with big lakes.  The progress
  dialog gives a bit more feedback about this now.  It WILL complete;
  just give it time.

- Flat (non-planet) terrain mostly disappears when viewed from beneath due
  to back-face culling.

- Export to Blender doesn't support emissive terrain.

- Doing the clouds as a mesh might seem pointless but there
  are plans to perturb the mesh to produce weather systems.
  Maybe add some height too.
