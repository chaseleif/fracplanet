ABOUT
=====
[This was the original "Project Purpose and Summarization" for sourceforge.]
Software to generate random planets and terrain with oceans, mountains, icecaps and rivers.
Parameters are specified interactively and the results displayed using OpenGL.
The generated objects can be dumped in Pov-Ray format.
Coded using C++ and STL.  Uses Qt and OpenGL libraries.  Should work on any platform with these available.

BUILDING
========
This has only been tested on RH8.0.

You should just be able to do

  ./BUILD

(All this does is a qmake followed by a make!)

This will give you a "fracplanet" executable which you can run with
  ./fracplanet
or install where you like.

USING
=====
After changing ANY of the terrain generation parameters, you must hit "regenerate" to create and display a new model.
This keeps the random seeds for terrain and river generation the same.
There are a couple of extra buttons which also change the random seed for the terrain or river network before regenerating,
Most of the parameter entry fields have tooltips on them which gives an idea of what they're about.

PERFORMANCE
===========
The biggest factor influencing performance (both generation and display) is the degree of subdivision.
At subdivision level 8 (for a planet) around 200MB of memory is required.
On a 2.4GHz machine with a GeForce4 and the Nvidia OpenGL drivers display rates start to suffer around subdivision level 7.

When generating many rivers at high levels of subdivision, the river generation progress bar may stall for long periods 
(this is generally due to a large lake being formed somewhere).

INSTALL
=======
Doing 
  make install
will attempt to install the executable in /usr/local/bin


BUILDING CODE DOCUMENTATION
===========================
If you have doxygen (and graphviz) and want to build the documentation subdirectory too, execute 
  make doc

RAY TRACING OUTPUT
==================
Once you have run fracplanet and saved a planet/landscape (as e.g terrain.pov and terrain.inc), do e.g
  povray -Q9 -geometry 768x576 terrain.pov
Expect to get a lot of "determinant too small" messages, especially when using high degrees of subdivision.

CLEANING UP
===========
To clean up this directory, do
  make clean
which deletes everything except the doc directory.
Do 
  make realclean
to get rid of everything including the doc directory.
