- Option to save a raster map (cylindrical projection for spheres)
  for terrain colours, heights, and specular (mainly for sea... and snow ?)

-----

- Move blender/pov save parameters into nested classes,
  pass parameters into lowest-level save fns rather than multiple args.
- Scale factor for blender output.
- Ability to load/save fracplanet parameters (simple keyword=value text file)
- Mesh optimisation.
- Save clouds as some more blender-friendly texture type thing.
- Rename Save to Export.
- Cloud controls.  Noise parameters and thresholds.
- More control over cloud undersides, shadowing etc (c.f on/off in POVRay).
  (Add checkboxes to POVRay save dialog).
  Maybe need better control over ambient, or actually use the ambient
  parameter on the render tab (move to colours).  Then shadows
  wouldn't be black; wouldn't get a night-side though, without varying
  ambient around sphere.
- Shadows of clouds on ground in OpenGL (needs shaders, shadow buffers etc).
- Optimise matix33 inversion
- End abuse of alpha as flag; just use it as the emissive quantity.
  Mesh then gets a flag for meaning of alpha channels.
- Terrain patches but with planetary geometry (ie curvature).
  This would give a sensible horizon when near the centre of the patch.
- Control over treeline and shoreline heights (these are hardwired currently).
- Clean up progress stuff; push steps->% (rate management) into progress API.
- std::auto_ptr sucks; use something better from boost
- Add perturbation decay rate for subdivision too.
- Noise perturbation in X&Y too;
  might help break up subdivision ridge artefacts
- Basic "man" page besides HTML
- Make more keys do stuff in fly mode
- Console mode app: read parameters, generate planet.
- Fix river/lake hang for high subdivision levels
- Perlin noise to modify terrain colours.
- Continue GUI procesing when progressing.
- More feedback (progress bar?) when building display list
  (unfortunately a lot of the delay happens in OpenGL when the list is completed)
- Borrow some improvements from sister evolvotron project
- Check for OpenGL errors
- Add control over heights at which colours switch.
- Improve code documentation.
- Save/load parameters.  Automatic mode (load parameters, generate model, exit).
- Seasonal variations.
  e.g snowline, ice packs on ocean.
- Ability to save sequences of models
  (probably by offline generation for parameter file load)
- Are we 64bit ready ?  Onwards to subdivision levels 12,13,14...
- Put ONLY the terrain data in the .inc file; rest in .pov or a different .inc
- Split up mesh file (3 parts: vertices, colours, meshing)
- Ringworld and Dyson sphere/hollow-Earth starting geometries for fun.
