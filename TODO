- "man" page instead/besides HTML
- Built-in manual like evolvotron
- Render tab setting to hide fly mode instructions
- Make more keys do stuff in fly mode
- Ability to load/save planet parameters (simple keyword=value text file)
- Console mode app: read parameters, generate planet.
- Split up mesh file (3 parts: vertices, colours, meshing)
- Fix river/lake hang for high subdivision levels
- Option to add Perlin noise to terrain (might make rivers meander more)
  Also completely noise generated terrain.
  Also modify terrain colours
- Continue GUI procesing when progressing.
- More feedback (progress bar?) when building display list
  (unfortunately a lot of the delay happens in OpenGL when the list is completed)
- Borrow some improvements from sister evolvotron project
- Check for OpenGL errors
- Add control over heights at which colours switch.
- Improve code documentation.
