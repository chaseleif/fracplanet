- Figure out how to build RPMs.
- Add "flight simulator" mode for getting in closer to terrain.
- Add colour-choosers for picking terrain colours.
- Add Unix "man" page.
- Improve code documentation.
- Move terrain computation and save into separate threads so interface isn't locked.
- Permit specification of ambient colour components (for planets with glowing red lava).
